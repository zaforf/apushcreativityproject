  <div class="text slide" style="font-size:36px;font-variant:small-caps;">The Market Economy and the Command Economy</div>
  <div class="text slide">by Zafir Nasim</div>
  <br><br>
  <div class="text slide">Hello! Welcome to my submission for the APUSH creativity project! This website was completely made from scratch by me. Here, I will explore the differences between a free market and a command economy, as well as the policies of countries that follow each of these systems. Let’s begin!</div>
  <br>
  <div class="text slide";>First, what is an economy, and what is economics?</div>
  <div class="text slide">An economy is a system of interrelated production and consumption activities that determine how scarce resources are allocated. Scarce resources can be anything from natural resources to even just money.</div>
  <div class="text slide">Economics is the study of this scarcity and its implications for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.</div>
  <br>
  <div class="text slide">In an economy, economic activity can be regulated. Governments can allow, disallow, or limit certain economic activities. The market economy, or free market, and the command economy are the two polar extremes on this spectrum of the organization of economic activity. Let's explore them now.</div>
</div>
<div class="parallax" style="background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559330715-755457f12392?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2671&q=80');"></div>

<div style="margin:100px;">
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-size:30px;font-variant:small-caps;">The Market Economy</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">Very simply, economic activity in a market economy is unplanned and unrestricted. These types of economies are closely associated with capitalism. Two fundamental aspects of market economies make this possible:</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text"><li>Private ownership of the means of production</li></ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">Private ownership means that individuals or businesses own factories, tools, and other resources to produce goods and services. People are incentivized to produce things of value to keep or trade since, because of scarcity, their ownership is meaningful. For example, if someone owns a lake, they are incentivized to maintain it if it generates revenue through recreation or fishing. This results in innovation to maintain that lake, investment in new technologies, and the creation of jobs to maintain it.</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text"><li>Voluntary exchanges between economic agents</li></ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">Voluntary exchanges mean that people can make economic decisions based on what’s best for their interests, and those decisions are unrestricted. Since people can choose what they buy, there is an incentive to appeal to customers and innovate for the sake of profit.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">However, there are drawbacks to a completely unregulated economy. It can lead to inequality, as those who own the means of production can accumulate vastly more wealth than those who do not (even destroying the environment in the process). Similarly, when one business dominates a market, there is less competition, which can lead to less-voluntary exchanges where only one business produces the high-demand items and thus can set unreasonable prices.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-style:italic">Advertising, as a form of competition, is an important part of a market economy</div>
</div>

<div style="margin:100px;">
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-size:30px;font-variant:small-caps;">The Command Economy</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">A command economy is a system in which the government makes all production and consumption decisions. This approach is meant to ensure that resources are allocated in a way that benefits society as a whole, rather than just a few individuals, and is most commonly associated with socialism and communism. In short, the government:</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text"><li>Owns most or all of the industries and businesses</li><li>Decides what goods and services will be produced, how much will be produced, and at what price they will be sold</li></ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">In other words, individual consumers and businesses have little to no say in how the economy operates.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">One of the key drawbacks of a command economy is that it can stifle innovation and entrepreneurship. There are no incentives for profit since every exchange is under the government’s control and there are no means of production for people to take advantage of. Without these incentives or even the freedom to make individual decisions, there is little motivation for individuals or businesses to invest in new ideas or technologies.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">Additionally, command economies can struggle with shortages and surpluses of goods and services. Without the feedback of market demand and supply, it can be difficult for central authorities to accurately predict what resources will be needed and when, leading to inefficiencies in production and distribution. Furthermore, prices are set by government officials rather than by natural means, often making them biased or unreasonable. Because of this, command economies are called less efficient than market economies.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-style:italic">North Korea, along with China and the former Soviet Union, are examples of command economies</div>

<div style="margin:100px;">
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-size:30px;font-variant:small-caps;">Key People</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text"><li>Adam Smith</li></ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">In his seminal work, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, commonly shortened to The Wealth of Nations and published in 1776, Smith described the capitalist system as it replaced the then-dying mercantilist system. He held that our individual need to fulfill self-interest also results in societal benefit through a force called the invisible hand. He was the first economist to examine market activity, and his works marked the birth of modern capitalism and modern economics. As such, he is often labeled the father of economics.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">The invisible hand is not an actual force or entity. Instead, it is the overall effect that can be observed when consumers and producers engage in an unregulated, or market, economy.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">Smith, in his famous example, explained that a butcher sells his meat because of the profits he receives from it. It’s in the butcher’s interest to keep customers and make sales; therefore, naturally, the butcher wants to avoid bad meat and bad prices. Consequently, the butcher makes an effort to make good meat and sells it for a reasonable price that customers are willing to pay, increasing the value of the transaction as both parties benefit. In other words, the butcher’s pursuit of his own interests (profits) resulted in societal benefit by increasing the value of the transaction for both parties. Over a whole economy, this means the best interests of society are fulfilled, and this is what Smith labeled the invisible hand.</div>

<div style="margin:100px;">
  <ul name="text" class="text"><li>Karl Marx</li></ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">Karl Marx was a German philosopher and economist who most famously opposed the market economy that Smith espoused. In his view, capitalism, a term popularized by Marx, represented an oppressive and exploitative economic system where the bourgeoisie (the owners of the means of production) exploited the proletariat (the workers) for their own benefit. He believed that the free market resulted in inequality above all else and that only a communist system, where the means of production were owned by the workers through a command economy, could eliminate the exploitation of the proletariat and lead to a more equal distribution of wealth.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">Marx believed that the capitalist system was inherently unjust. His ideas later served as the foundation for future communist leaders, most notably in the USSR with Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text"><li>John Maynard Keynes</li></ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">John Maynard Keynes was a British economist who is most famous for his ideas on government intervention in the economy during times of crisis. He argued that the market economy could not effectively respond to major recessions and depressions and therefore supported government intervention as necessary.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">His ideas were a response to the Great Depression and were influential in post-World War II economies through the system of Keynesian economics, which took his name.</div>

<div style="margin:100px;">
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-size:30px;font-variant:small-caps;">Key Countries</div>
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-size:24px;font-variant:small-caps;">United States</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">While the US is often considered the quintessential market economy, with its economic interventions, it is more of a mixed economy. This is quite common for countries, as the levels of organization of the economy lie on a scale, and having mixed economies can reduce some of the shortfalls of the two extremes.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">One notable example is the New Deal policies enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. Note that they allow greater government intervention in the economy, a feature more likened to the command economy. These policies include:</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text">
    <li>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) created to protect investors and maintain efficient markets by enforcing securities laws</li>
    <li>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) created to insure bank deposits up to $250,000 to promote confidence in the national banking system</li>
    <li>The Social Security Act which turned the US into a limited welfare state, where the government redistributes some wealth to protect health and well-being of citizens</li>
  </ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">These types of policies extended after World War II with the Great Society and use of Keynesian economics:</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text">
    <li>Medicare and Medicaid provides medical insurance to the elderly and the poor, respectively, by redistributing wealth</li>
    <li>The Economic Opportunity Act created the Office of Economic Opportunity, which coordinated anti-poverty programs</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="parallax" style="background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534469589579-86bd01bc003a?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1742&q=80');"></div>

<div style="margin:100px">
  <div name="text" class="text">However, as predicted by Adam Smith, these government interventions did not always help the economy. One notable example is the gas shortages in the US during the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s. During this time, the government slashed gas prices to make cheap gas easily available; however, gas stations, as a result, had less incentive to stay open longer as their operating costs exceeded their revenue. Similarly, oil companies had no incentive to produce much gas, and large-scale shortages and massive gas lines emerged. These lines disappeared, however, after controls were eliminated.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">Overall, the US has both a high level of government intervention and a strong market economy. Today, it is rated 25th out of 180 countries on the Heritage Foundation’s 2023 Index of Economic Freedom.</div>

<div style="margin:100px;">
  <div name="text" class="text" style="font-size:24px;font-variant:small-caps;">Soviet Union</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">The USSR, especially after World War II, fought a fierce ideological battle with the US in the Cold War. This battle was between the ideologies of communism, marked by a command economy, and capitalism, marked by a market economy.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">The USSR took advantage of its command economy as much as it could. Stalin leveraged the total governmental control of the economy, not found in a market economy, in his Five-Year Plans starting in 1928. He set ambitious production goals for heavy industry (iron, coal, steel, etc.) and methods to achieve these goals in order to transform the USSR into a modern economy that could compete with those of the West.</div>
  <ul name="text" class="text">
    <li>Agriculture was collectivized to increase output, feed workers, and export for income for industrialization</li>
    <li>Workers were strictly regulated, with absences harshly punished and wages deducted if targets were not met</li>
    <li>Ambitious targets were set for every industry, especially in heavy industry</li>
    <li>Schools were built to improve literacy and encourage more skilled labor overall</li>
  </ul>
  <div name="text" class="text">In 1932, Stalin declared the First Five-Year Plan a success: production of electricity tripled, and coal and iron output doubled. These economic plans would continue until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, with industrialization and collectivization as the main policies. During this time, Soviet engineering became on par with the west; the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, and a human, Yuri Gagarin, were put into space; and the Soviet military served as a formidable foe against the US through the Cold War.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="parallax" style="background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1547448415-e9f5b28e570d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1740&q=80');"></div>
 
 <div style="margin:100px;">
  <div name="text" class="text">However, it must be noted that the Soviet government likely inflated figures to seem more impressive and superior. Furthermore, the USSR suffered a tremendous human cost. Rich farmers, labeled "Kulaks," were seen as enemies of the state simply through their wealth and were attacked and deported as a class of people (in a process called "dekulakization"). In Ukraine, Stalin set impossibly high grain quotas to punish Ukrainians who wanted a separate identity from the USSR. When villages were not able to meet the quotas, special teams were sent to search houses and seize food, and when starving farmers attempted to leave, they were simply sent back. A law was even introduced that made stealing a few stalks of grain punishable by death. What resulted was the Holodomor, literally "death by hunger" in Ukrainian, which claimed almost 4 million lives in a man-made famine.</div>
  <div name="text" class="text">Finally, there was an overall lack of freedom and democracy in the USSR, as the government controlled everything. Additionally, while heavy industries improved greatly, consumer industries were neglected, and the standard of living remained low. These weaknesses contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</div>
